# Writing Syntax Section

This file demonstrates all the main syntax of MyST Markdown (MyST v2).  
All examples are adapted using the MOF (Metal–Organic Framework) theme,  
and the latest recommended `:::` fenced directive syntax is adopted throughout.

Authors can directly copy these templates and modify the content. Each section includes an official documentation link with more extensible functions.

## 2. Admonitions

[Callouts & Admonitions Documents](https://mystmd.org/guide/admonitions)

:::
```

Available types:  
- note  
- tip  
- important  
- warning  
- admonition  

---

### 2.1 tip

```
:::{tip} What is coordination polymerization?
MOFs are essentially crystalline frameworks formed by metal ions and multidentate organic ligands through coordination bonds.
:::
```

## 3. Figures

[Figures Documents](https://mystmd.org/guide/figures)

MyST recommends using the fenced directive:
```
:::{figure} path/to/image
:name: image-label   
:width: 70%
:align: center
Figure Caption  (If the :name: tag is not added, the caption will not be automatically numbered as Figure N)
:::
```

### 3.1 Local Images

## 4. Math

[Math and Equation Documents](https://mystmd.org/guide/math)

MyST supports all LaTeX math syntax.

### 4.1 Inline Formulas

The porosity of a MOF can be written as $\phi = V_\text{void} / V_\text{cell}$.

`$\phi = V_\text{void} / V_\text{cell}$`

---

### 4.2 Block Formulas

```
$$
V_\text{cell} = abc\sqrt{
1 + 2\cos\alpha\cos\beta\cos\gamma -
\cos^2\alpha - \cos^2\beta - \cos^2\gamma
}
$$
```

$$
V_\text{cell} = abc\sqrt{
1 + 2\cos\alpha\cos\beta\cos\gamma -
\cos^2\alpha - \cos^2\beta - \cos^2\gamma
}
$$

```
$$
\begin{aligned}
q(P) &= q_{\max} \frac{bP}{1 + bP} \\
\phi &= \frac{V_\text{void}}{V_\text{cell}}
\end{aligned}
$$
```

$$
\begin{aligned}
q(P) &= q_{\max} \frac{bP}{1 + bP} \\

:label: theorem-1
MOFs are generally more stable if the coordination number of the metal node is sufficiently high.

:::{prf:proof} Proof
:label: proof-theorem-1
A high coordination number restricts the degrees of freedom of the framework structure, thereby increasing its stability.
